## Tips for Safer Use

Maximize safety while using bunni executor roblox by implementing strategic practices recommended by our bunni executor discord reddit community. Always test unfamiliar scripts on alternate accounts before running them on your main profile. Even verified scripts from the integrated hub should be previewed to understand their functions.

Avoid using obvious cheat features (god mode, instant win, etc.) in public servers where other players can report suspicious behavior. Reserve aggressive scripts for private servers or single-player experiences. The bunni lol executor roblox provides powerful capabilities, but discretion prevents unnecessary account actions.

Keep Bunni Executor updated through the automatic update system or manual checks on bunni executor github. Outdated versions may contain security vulnerabilities or lack compatibility with recent Roblox anti-cheat updates. Enable update notifications in settings to receive instant alerts.

Join the bunni executor discord server to stay informed about detection risks. Community members quickly report if specific scripts or features are causing bans, giving you advance warning. The Discord also announces critical security updates that require immediate action.

Use the sandboxed execution environment feature for untested scripts. This isolation prevents potentially malicious code from accessing system files or personal data. While the script hub contains verified scripts, community-shared scripts should always run in sandboxed mode first.

Configure reasonable cooldowns between script executions in the same game. Rapidly cycling through multiple scripts creates obvious patterns that anti-cheat systems detect. Natural pacing—running a script for full game sessions rather than constant switching—appears more legitimate.
